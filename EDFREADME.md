This are specific info for the hardware used in the EDF group of the University Antwerpn 

2021 

Ultra soon 

The VCC  is 5 V !!   So don't use this for 3.3 V devices !!! 

The LED's  are connected to 

   * GPIO 18 green L5  and L3 
   * GPIO 14 L1
   * GPIO 15 L2
   * GPIO 23 L4
   
 The Ultrsoon device is connected to   JC  ( BB = bread board )
 
   * name    JC       wire     PinBB     Usoon pin
   * VCC     pin 12    1   	   pin 1     VCC
   * GND     pin 10    3       pin 2     GND 
   * GPIO24  pin 8     5       pin 3     Echo
   * GPIO08  pin 6     7       pin 4     TRIG 
   * GPIO12  pin 4     9       pin 5      --
